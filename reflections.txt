# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    I estimate that I spent around 9 hours working on this project.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    The most rewarding challenge was learning how to filter the item types.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    I added a method to color code the item types in the lists, becuase color coding makes reading a list easier in my opinion.
    I added code to asciify the list titles, because I think the lists look better when the titles stand out.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    Learning and becoming more comfortable with ruby syntax and how to use various coding strategies more effectively.
